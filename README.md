# DL360G5 Fan modification
A quick tutorial on how to make your HD DL360G5 quieter. We will remove half the fans and trick the sensors to not report any problems.  

## Things you need  
- A DL360 G5  
- Basic tools  
- Some new screws if you want to increse the flow  
  
Read the entire instructions before starting, some steps may be easier to do in another order (L may be performed earlier).  
  
A. First, dissasemble your fans until you have this unit:

F. Then connect the blue wire to the green, but do NOT cut the green, just expose the leads:
